## Payment Workflow Examples

### Credit Card Payment Flow (with 3D Secure)

1. Customer enters payment information and submits order
2. System sends payment request to Stripe
3. If 3D Secure is required:
   - Order status is set to "pending_action"
   - Customer is redirected to 3D Secure authentication page via action_url
   - After authentication, customer is redirected back to the store
   - Stripe sends webhook notification to confirm payment status
   - System updates order status to "paid"
4. If 3D Secure is not required:
   - Payment is processed immediately
   - Order status is set to "paid"

### MobilePay Payment Flow

1. Customer selects MobilePay as payment method and provides phone number
2. System creates payment request with MobilePay
3. Customer is redirected to MobilePay app or web interface via action_url
4. Customer approves payment in MobilePay app
5. MobilePay sends webhook notification confirming payment authorization
6. System updates order status to "paid"
7. Admin can later capture the payment to complete the transaction

### PayPal Payment Flow

1. Customer selects PayPal as payment method
2. System creates payment request with PayPal
3. Customer is redirected to PayPal login page via action_url
4. Customer logs in to PayPal and approves payment
5. PayPal redirects customer back to store's return URL
6. System verifies payment status with PayPal API
7. Order status is updated to "paid"

### Admin Payment Management Flow

1. Customer places order and authorizes payment
2. Admin reviews order and decides to capture the payment
3. Admin uses the capture endpoint to process the payment
4. If needed, admin can issue partial or full refunds using the refund endpoint
5. For problematic payments, admin can cancel pending payments using the cancel endpoint
